nodeJSClientApp
===============

C# winform to a node server for real time chat. both the client app and web server show live changes

Please note that you might have to make changes to the server ip address in your config. It is currenlty set up to
use the localhost default address.
 
Links to information that I found useful can be found within the source code itself.

Please fork and make any changes, this was used as a learning experience to connect client apps to servers with 
real time communication.
